# Paperclip Playground

Playing around with paperclip.

Things I want to look at:

* Thumbnails
* Watermarking
* Multiple file uploads
* Amazon S3 storage
* attachment_on_the_fly (not really paperclip)
* :hash interpolation
* Updating existing thumbnails on style changes

# Items

The first experiment will use an "Item" model (like a catalog item, or whatever) with an associated image and thumbnail.
